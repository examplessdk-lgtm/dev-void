/**
 * Make app log text safe to print to a terminal. App logs often echo request
 * data from anonymous visitors, so escape sequences in them must not reach the
 * terminal as commands (clipboard writes, hyperlinks, screen clears, cursor
 * moves or carriage-return overwrites).
 *
 * SGR color codes, newlines and tabs are kept so ordinary colored or
 * multi-line logs read the same. A text that keeps any SGR code ends with a
 * reset, so styles such as conceal cannot hide the lines printed after it.
 * Every other complete CSI or OSC sequence is removed whole, so a hyperlink
 * shows only its visible text and a line clear leaves no stray "[K". Every
 * other C0/C1 control character is dropped on its own; an escape sequence that
 * is incomplete, such as an OSC with no terminator, loses only its control
 * characters and the rest prints as plain text instead of being swallowed.
 *
 * Keep this module free of imports: the Cloudflare operation process is a
 * separate bundle entry that must stay small.
