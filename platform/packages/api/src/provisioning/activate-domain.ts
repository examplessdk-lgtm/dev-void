// spread it directly. Shared by the status route and the reconciliation cron so

// the every-2-min fast tier would otherwise fire ~N PATCH/2min and risk 429ing
// other tenants' hostname operations, while CF's own sub-minute early retries

  // The anti-wildcard-hijack lever is the OWNERSHIP gate, NOT the cert-DCV
  // method: a wildcard CNAME (`*.victim → cname.void.app`) cannot forge a
  // per-host `_cf-custom-hostname` TXT value, so ownership stays unsatisfied
  // and `status` never reaches `active`. Cert DCV (HTTP-based, edge-validated,

  // AND the HTTP `ownership_verification_http` — is defense-in-depth on top
  // of that (CF stops returning them once ownership is proven), so we refuse
  // to route even if CF ever surfaced `active` with an ownership challenge

  // it would break a domain whenever a user removed the TXT after setup, for
