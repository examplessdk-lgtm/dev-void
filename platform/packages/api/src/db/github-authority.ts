 * connection records the project owner/admin who completed the repository proof;
 * that authorizer must still be the owner or an admin.
 * An `all` install covers every repo; a `selected` install requires the immutable
 * repo id in its cache. This is the shared predicate used by webhook and OIDC
 * resolvers as well as enqueue and final startup checks.
