/**
 * Re-run a build for an already-pushed commit, driven by GitHub's "Re-run" /
 * "Re-run all checks" buttons (`check_run:rerequested` / `check_suite:rerequested`).
 *
 * Deliberately reuses the PUSH pipeline rather than inventing a second way to
 * enqueue: same connection resolution, same renamed-repo self-heal, same
 * fail-closed branch-head freshness gate, same `supersedeAndCreateContainerBuild`.
 * A re-run must not become a back door that deploys a commit a push could not.
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION is the same shape as `push`: the payload is HMAC-verified and
 * bound to an installation we know, and GitHub only offers the button to users
 * with write access on the repo. We add nothing on top, and `sender` is ignored.
 *
 * That is NOT strictly weaker than push, and the difference is deliberate rather
 * than overlooked. Branch protection can restrict pushes to `main` to named
 * users, teams, or apps while everyone else keeps repo write — so the set of
 * people who can click Re-run is a SUPERSET of the set who can push the branch.
 * The freshness gate bounds what that buys them: the only commit they can build
 * is the branch head, which our push pipeline already built and deployed. The one
 * real capability is re-deploying the current head, which matters when a rollback
 * is active — a rerun can roll forward onto the branch head again. We accept it,
 * because the alternative is mapping GitHub actors to per-project deploy rights,
 * and a connection carries exactly one Void user; gating on `sender` would break
 * ordinary team use to close a hole bounded by "redeploy what is already HEAD".
 *
 * FRESHNESS is what makes it safe. The head SHA must still be the connected
 * branch's head (`identical`), so re-running an old check cannot roll production
 * back to an abandoned commit. Re-running a check on a superseded commit is
 * therefore an intentional no-op.
 *
 * A `check_suite` refusal reports NOTHING, deliberately. The Checks API cannot
 * conclude a suite at all — GitHub derives that from the runs — and the suite
 * payload carries no run ids.
 *
 * Deriving them from our own build rows was tried and REVERTED: the row is not
 * authoritative for the `github_actions` executor, whose check is completed
 * straight from `workflow_run.conclusion` independent of the status CAS, so a
 * `cancelled` row can carry a published `success` and rewriting it from the row
 * would turn a passing required check into a blocking one.
 *
 * A bounded read DOES exist (`GET /repos/{o}/{r}/check-suites/{id}/check-runs`
 * with `check_name` + `per_page`), so cost is not the objection. The objection is
 * that the premise is unverified: it is not established that GitHub leaves our
 * runs needing resolution at all — a suite rerequest resets the SUITE's own state,
 * and a run that kept its conclusion is not pending. Re-PATCHing a run with the
 * conclusion it already has, hoping the suite recomputes, is a guess about GitHub
 * internals, and the last guess in this area shipped the bug above. Verify it
 * against a real suite rerequest on staging before building on it.
 *
 * DEDUP falls out of the shared helper: a `failed` build for the commit is never
 * reused, so the failing case this exists for always enqueues fresh work. A
 * commit whose build already succeeded AND is live reuses that build and enqueues
 * nothing — the check is green and there is nothing to redo.
 *
 * `github_actions` connections cannot be re-run from here: their build is driven
 * by the workflow, and nothing in the Checks API can start one. They report an
 * explicit ignore rather than silently doing nothing.
