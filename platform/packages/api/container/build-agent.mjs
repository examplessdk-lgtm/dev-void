/**
 * Build agent for "Deploy on GitHub".
 *
 * Runs inside the Cloudflare Container managed by the BuildManager Durable
 * Object (packages/api/src/build-manager.ts). It is intentionally THIN: it does
 * not re-implement deploy packaging. It downloads the pushed source, installs
 * the repo's dependencies, and runs the REAL `void deploy` CLI, which performs
 * all build + upload work using the short-lived scoped VOID_TOKEN.
 *
 * Contract with the DO (env vars the DO injects at start()):
 *   BUILD_ID            build row id (logging only)
 *   PROJECT_ID          project id (logging only)
 *   PROJECT_SLUG        project slug
 *   SOURCE_TARBALL_URL  GitHub source tarball (codeload) URL
 *   SOURCE_TOKEN        GitHub installation token (Bearer) to fetch the tarball
 *   VOID_TOKEN          project-scoped deploy JWT (consumed by `void deploy`).
 *                       Scrubbed from the install + any untrusted child env and
 *                       re-injected ONLY for the trusted `void deploy` spawn.
 *   VOID_API_URL        https://api.void.cloud (or staging)
 *   VOID_PROXY_URL      Explicit platform resource proxy used for prerendering
 *   VOID_PROJECT        project slug passed to `void deploy --project`
 *   CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID     staging CF Access service-token id (staging builds
 *   CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET only). Like VOID_TOKEN: scrubbed from untrusted
 *                       children and re-injected ONLY for the `void deploy` spawn
 *                       so it can pass CF Access on the staging API host.
 *   DO_LOG_URL          full URL of the DO's log sink, e.g. https://manager/logs
 *   AGENT_TOKEN         per-build secret presented on this agent's DO control
 *                       POSTs (/logs, /status, /cancel). NEVER forwarded into
 *                       untrusted repo child processes (see `sanitizeChildEnv`).
 *
 * DO endpoints (see build-manager.ts `fetch`):
 *   POST /logs    body: Array<{ line, stream, ts, lineEnding? }>
 *   POST /status  body: { status }
 *   POST /cancel  (DO -> agent; handled by this server)
 *   GET  /        (DO -> agent; health check)
 *
 * Transport note: the DO talks to the container over the Container model. The
 * agent talks back to the DO by POSTing to DO_LOG_URL (resolved via the
 * Container outbound-interception chain). ALL DO writes here are best-effort —
 * a transport failure must never abort the build. Logs are also retained
 * in-process and exposed at `GET /logs?since=<seq>` so the DO can PULL them if
 * push transport is unavailable (see open questions in the PR).

 *
 * Bounded on three axes, in order of which one actually fires:
 *
 *   1. STALL — no bytes for `stallTimeoutMs` aborts the attempt. This is the real

 *      a dead stream trips it in 20s instead of holding the build until the DO's
 *      `enforceTimeout`.
 *   2. RETRY — a transient failure starts over from an empty WORK_DIR. Degraded
 *      streams often recover briefly, so a fresh connection is a real chance
 *      rather than a formality.
 *   3. PHASE BUDGET — one wall clock across ALL attempts. Catches the case no
 *      stall timer can see: a steady trickle that never pauses long enough to
 *      look dead.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT bounded by a per-attempt wall clock or a throughput floor.
 * Either would fail a large repo on a slow but honest link.
 *
 * Every dependency is injectable so the retry policy is unit-testable without a
 * network or a `tar` child. Timers are real — pass small millisecond values.

/**
 * Termination handler for the agent process. The agent is PID 1 in the build

 * signal to PID 1 ONLY when a handler is installed for it — an unhandled SIGTERM
 * to PID 1 is silently dropped. The BuildManager DO tears a build down with
 * `stop()`, which sends a bare SIGTERM and never escalates to SIGKILL on its own;
 * without this handler that SIGTERM is ignored, the container keeps running, and
 * it pins one of the fleet's global instance slots indefinitely. Installing the
 * handler is therefore what makes `stop()` work at all.
 *
 * Mirrors POST /cancel: flag the build cancelled and SIGTERM the active build
 * child (a cooperative child exits and the container terminates), then exit so the DO's
 * onStop fires and the slot is reclaimed. A child that ignores its own SIGTERM is
 * the DO's `destroy()` (SIGKILL) backstop, not ours.
